# doubleBluetoothConnection
This repository holds code for connecting to 2 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) nRF52832 Sparkfun Breakout devices.

*Note*

I used the pre-built Bluetooth Low Energy sample library code provided on Android Studio. However, I proceeded to add some of my own code on top of the framework. Therefore, most of the file names are the same as the sample code files. Additionally, the basic securing a connection code is provided through the sample code. However, the code which performs the read/write/notify to the Bluetooth devices is written by me. The initial sample code only included one connection. However, I have added the code for the second connection.
